We need to significantly enhance our 'Simply Saral' application to make it more comprehensive and fully functional. Here are the detailed requirements:

Backend Expansion:

Add a complete database structure for government schemes (central/state) with fields:

Scheme name, description, eligibility, benefits, application process, documents required, official link

Create similar structured datasets for:

Competitive exams (UPSC, SSC, State PSCs)

Educational programs (Scholarships, Skill India)

State-specific welfare programs

Frontend Improvements:

Implement a dynamic filtering system allowing users to filter by:

Category (Education, Health, Employment)

Target Group (Students, Farmers, Women)

State/Central programs

Add search functionality with auto-suggestions

New Features:

User accounts with personalized recommendations

Application tracking system for schemes

Exam calendar with notifications

Multilingual support (starting with Hindi/English)

Quality Assurance:

Implement comprehensive unit tests for all new components

Conduct integration testing for API endpoints

Perform UI/UX testing across devices

Set up error logging and monitoring

Technical Requirements:

Maintain clean code architecture

Ensure proper documentation for new features

Optimize database queries for performance

Implement proper caching mechanisms

Deployment:

Create a staging environment for testing

Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

Configure proper backup systems for database

Please:

Analyze the existing codebase first

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

Create all necessary files with proper code

Include test cases for each component

Provide debugging support throughout the process

The application should maintain its current functionality while adding these enhancements. All changes should follow best practices for security, performance, and maintainability."

Additional Tips for Replit:

After giving this prompt, you can share specific files or code snippets that need modification

Ask the AI to explain its implementation approach before proceeding

Request regular progress updates during the generation process

Ask for validation steps to ensure all features work correctly
